This module allow easily export data into an attachment, using Odoo native exporting tool.
Its meant to be used by submodules needing to export data and add the following features :
- Easily re-order the fields to export (actually comes from base_export_manager module)
- Allow to customize the fields label to have a fully customizable header
- Allow to customize the filename
- Allow to add more data (not from fields), this module implement the possibility to add static data
but it can easily be extended to add more complex logic to get some advanced custom data

It supports csv and xlsx format but other one could easily be added

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

I believe this module could be refactored a bit along with pattern_import_export, to become a dependency of pattern_import_export. (https://github.com/akretion/pattern-import-export/)
Including the missing feature (customizable field name and file name) and possibility to add more info in export (static value...) could be done directly in pattern_import_export, but it is a big module with a lot of features to install for this small need.
Actually all the helpers to get configurable data from export may or not be usefull for other formats. If you want to implement a very specific xml for instance (to be used with purchase_edi) you may want to by pass all that. That is why export field and additional data fields are invisible in case file_format is not csv and xls.
In case of a new format implementation, one should manage if this is export tools is usefull or not.
