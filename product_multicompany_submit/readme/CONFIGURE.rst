Add users to approval and submittal groups and have them use the new menu items.

In order to test it, note the following:
  - This module only works in multi-company, multi-catalogue mode.
  - Because product submittal states are tracked and messages are generated, users need an email address on their partner form

Also note that after installing, you need to ensure consistency for the fields state_multicompany_submit and multicompany_origin_company_id according to your own company data
