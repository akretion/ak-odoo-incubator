Sale Delivery No REcompute
==========================

When changing a carrier from a sale order, keep the original price by defaut.
It is useful when Odoo is not in charge of computing the delivery price and when the shipping fee is paid
in advance and should not change enven in case of carrier change. (e-commerce outside Odoo like prestashop solution)
