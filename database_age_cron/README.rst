This module adds a simple cron that allows to know easily what is the age of the database

You just have to check the `lastcall` date of the cron (via Odoo or via SQL)
to know when it ran for the last time.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

To make it work, you will need to deactivate the cron once the database is not in production anymore.

For instance with a script that runs:

.. code:: sql

    UPDATE ir_cron SET active='f' WHERE cron_name = 'Database Age Cron';
