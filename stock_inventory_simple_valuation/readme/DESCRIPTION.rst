This module adds a way to get an approximate evaluation of the value of your inventory lines. This is useful in cases where client product data is incomplete.

When there is no standard way to get a product's price, this module looks firstly in the new "manual cost" field of inventory lines, then in different places to guess the price: supplier prices, invoices, purchase orders, etc, in an easily extensible way.
